This is the reposetory to store all the practicals's code, and any other materials which i have used. 
This contains the practicals for Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Advanced Computer Networks and Capstone Course (tbh, idk what that is).
This was done with the intent to safeguard my works and to maintains my github streak(XD).
This code can be used for your practicals if needed, but the you must completely and fully understand the code to use it (as i have added almost no comments in the code).


with pure intents, 
yours sicerely,
